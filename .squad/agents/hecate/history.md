## Project: AuroraFix (seeded 2026-03-21)

**Namespace:** AuroraFix · .NET MAUI net10.0

**Services I own:**

### AuroraService (`Services/AuroraService.cs`)
- `GetCurrentKpIndexAsync()` — NOAA `planetary_k_index_1m.json`, walks backwards for last nonzero `estimated_kp`
- `GetThreeDayForecastAsync(latitude)` — parses NOAA `3-day-geomag-forecast.txt` (brittle text parsing)
- `GetForecastForLocationAsync(city, lat, lon)` — combines Kp + location into `AuroraForecast`
- `CalculateProbability(kp, latitude)` — private switch-based formula (DIFFERENT from Helper — ViewModel uses Helper)
- `GetActivityLevel(kp)` — static: Low/Medium/Active/Storm
- `GetIconEmoji(prob)` — static: colored circle emojis (red/orange/yellow/green)

### WeatherService (`Services/WeatherService.cs`)
- Open-Meteo API, no key
- `GetCurrentWeatherAsync(lat, lon)` — fetches current `cloud_cover`
- `GetThreeDayForecastAsync(lat, lon)` — fetches daily `cloud_cover_mean` (3 days)
- `GetWeatherIcon(cc)` — static: star/cloud emojis
- **Note:** Manual singleton pattern (`Instance`) — bypasses DI

### GeocodingService (`Services/GeocodingService.cs`)
- `GetLocationFromCityAsync(cityName)` — predefined list first, then Nominatim
- Fallback on error: returns Östersund coords (63.8267, 16.0534)
- User-Agent: `"AuroraFixApp/1.0"` (OSM requirement)

**Known issues:**
- Duplicate probability formulas (AuroraService private vs Helper)
- WeatherService singleton bypasses DI
- NOAA text parser is fragile

### 2026-03-21: Unicode/Swedish city search bug investigation & fix

**What was broken:**
- `NominatimResult.Lat` and `.Lon` were typed as `double`, but the Nominatim API returns these values as **JSON strings** (quoted, e.g. `"lat":"63.82"`). System.Text.Json threw a `JsonException` when trying to deserialize a string value into a `double` property. This exception was silently caught and the code fell back to Östersund coordinates for every non-predefined city search, making all custom city searches return wrong data without any visible error.
- `GetPopularNordicLocations()` lookup used `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`, which only guarantees case-folding for ASCII (a-z/A-Z). For Unicode characters like Ö/ö, this can be unreliable across platforms.

**No issues found in:**
- `MainPage.xaml` — Entry has no Keyboard type restriction, no Behaviors, no MaxLength, no character filtering. Clean.
- `MainPageViewModel.cs` — No regex, no character whitelist, no input validation that strips or blocks characters. `Uri.EscapeDataString` was already correctly used in GeocodingService for the Nominatim URL.

**What was fixed in `GeocodingService.cs`:**
1. Changed `NominatimResult.Lat` and `.Lon` from `double` to `string`, and parse with `double.Parse(..., CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)` at the point of use. This correctly handles Nominatim's string-quoted coordinates.
2. Changed predefined city lookup from `OrdinalIgnoreCase` to `InvariantCultureIgnoreCase` for robust, culture-safe Unicode case-insensitive matching.
3. Added `using System.Globalization;` import.

**Outcome:** All city names — including those with Swedish/European special characters (Å, Ä, Ö, ü, é, etc.) and hyphens — now correctly resolve via Nominatim. Predefined cities (including "Östersund" as default) continue to work as before.
